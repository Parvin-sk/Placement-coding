Imagine you are part of a software development team at a tech company, and your manager has assigned you a task related to financial data analysis. The company's accounting system has just reported four key financial metrics for a project, denoted as a b c and d. However, there is a twist: some of these metrics might be negative indicating a loss. Your task is to identify and sum up all the negative metrics.

If there are no negative values, the system should return 0. ensuring no incorrect financial interpretation. Your solution will help the finance team quickly assess any losses that need immediate attention,
Objective: Write a program that takes four integers as input and outputs the sum of all negative integers. If there are no negative integers, the output should be 0.

Example Test Case:

Input:

a=-3

• b=7

c = -1

od=4

Output:
-4


code:
class Negativenumbers {
    public static int negativenumbersAdd(int[] arr) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] < 0) {
                sum += arr[i];
            }
        }
        return sum == 0 ? 0 : sum; 
    }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        int[] arr = {-3, 7, -1, 4};
        System.out.println(negativenumbersAdd(arr));
    }
}
